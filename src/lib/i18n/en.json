				"paragraph1": "Tu Duo Duo had a quirky hobby — collecting buttons.",
				"paragraph2": "Her cloth pocket was stuffed with round buttons, square buttons, and patterned buttons. She even held three of the shiniest ones in her arms when she slept.",
				"paragraph3": "One evening, raindrops tapped “dada” against the leaves. Tu Duo Duo hid in an old oak tree hollow, and suddenly, her hand brushed against something soft and fluffy.",
				"paragraph4": "It was a cloth fox missing an eye! An empty thread loop was sewn where its eye should be, making it look so pitiful.",
				"paragraph5": "“Want to try this?” Tu Duo Duo took out a red button. As soon as she sewed it on, the cloth fox’s eye suddenly flickered — and to her surprise, it spoke: “Thank you, little rabbit!”",
				"paragraph6": "It turned out the cloth fox was Little Hedgehog’s old toy, which the wind had blown into the tree hollow. Tu Duo Duo found a blue button for its other eye. Right away, the cloth fox jumped up, wiggled the hole in its tail, and said: ”If we had a star-shaped button to fix this spot, I could take you to see the fireflies!“",
				"paragraph7": "Tu Duo Duo quickly rummaged through her pocket — and sure enough, she felt a star-shaped button that glowed faintly!",
				"paragraph8": "As soon as she finished sewing it on, the cloth fox’s tail lifted up and carried Tu Duo Duo out of the tree hollow.",
				"paragraph9": "In the night, fireflies swirled around them like scattered stars. From far away, they heard Little Hedgehog’s excited shout",
				"paragraph10": "— turns out he was holding a lantern, looking for the cloth fox!",
				"paragraph11": "Later on, Tu Duo Duo always kept an empty spot in her button pocket. She said it was for the next friend who needed help."
